# CNN
In Image Classification project, loaded data into jupyter file and using  Convolution layers, padding, Data Augmentation and  pre-trained model VGG16, model accuracy is improved.

In Emotion Detection From images project, dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013 that contain pixels of images, then they are converted into image dimension and then using convolution neural network, model accurecy is evaluated. To enhance model accuracy, Data Augmentaion is performed.
