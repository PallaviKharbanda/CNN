# CNN
In this repository, the two image classification models are created. First file shows how we can get images directly into our jupyter file and classifying them.

In multiclass classification project, I have uploaded a csv file that contain pixels of images, then they are converted into image dimension and then using convolution neural
network, classification is done. For second project, dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013
