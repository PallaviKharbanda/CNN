# CNN
In Image Classification project, loaded data into jupyter file and using different Convolution layers, filters, padding, dense layers, activation functions, optimizers and different hyperparameters as dropout layer, EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, BatchNormalization,  model accuracy is improved.

In Emotion Detection From images project, dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013 that contain pixels of images, then they are converted into image dimension and then using convolution neural network, model accuracy is evaluated. To enhance model accuracy, Data Augmentaion is performed.
