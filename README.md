In this repository, the two image classification models are created. First file shows how we can get images directly into our jupyter file and classifying them using Convolution layers, padding, Data Augmentation and finally applying pre-trained model VGG16 for better accuracy of our model.

In multiclass classification project, I have uploaded a csv file that contain pixels of images, then they are converted into image dimension and then using convolution neural
network, classification is done. For second project, dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013
